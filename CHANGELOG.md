# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenBand. The v0.2 work follows [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md).

## Unreleased — v0.2 "The AI that listens"

### F1 · Transactions and undo by intent
- Labelled undo history: each step records its label, source (UI/AI) and how many commands it groups.
- Store transactions (`beginTransaction` / `endTransaction`, nestable): commits inside one become a single undo step; empty transactions leave no trace.
- AI commands are grouped automatically and closed after 4 s of silence, or explicitly with the new MCP tools `begin_change(label)` / `end_change()`; a user edit closes an open AI step instead of merging into it.
- New MCP tool `get_history`; `undo` / `redo` take `steps`.
- Drags and knob turns are one step each. Undo/redo tooltips show the label; the AI panel groups activity by step with an “Undo this” button.

### F0 · Test infrastructure
- Vitest (`npm test`, `npm run test:watch`) with Node as the default environment.
- Reference projects in `src/__fixtures__/`: the v0.1 demo exported as real v1 JSON, an empty project and a deliberately "dirty" one for the linter.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): typecheck and tests on every push and pull request.
- The WAM SDK is now loaded lazily so the command and store modules can be imported in Node.
